#
#   Environment setup script for Copperfield FX.
#
#   To use this script you should "cd" to the hfs directory where this
#   script is located and "source" it into your bash shell or from your
#   .profile script.
#
#   Alternatively you may copy this script, remove the first if
#   statement and change the setting of the "HFS" variable to be
#   the location of your installed Copperfield FX hfs directory.
#
#   Note that this script modifies your search path by inserting the
#   Copperfield FX bin directory at the beginning. It also explicitly sets
#   the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH which is used to
#   search for runtime libraries.
#
#   To run the script in quiet mode, specify the "-q" option on the
#   command line.
