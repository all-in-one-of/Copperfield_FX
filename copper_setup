#   To use this script you should "cd" to the hfs directory where this
#   script is located and "source" it into your shell or from your
#   .login script.

#   Houdini bin directory at the beginning. It may also sets the environment
#   variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH which is used to search for runtime libraries.
