===========

Node based animation, rendering and compositing tool.

At this stage it's even not a proof-of-concept thing. It's something else. But you can play with it at any time. Have fun!

The idea behind this project is to build open source node based all-in-one animaition and compositing software.

Why Python ?

Well. First of all i'm not a programmer, i just like to do some coding in my spare time. It takes much less time for me to prototype software in Python than in C++. If at any stage i would decide to speed up some
parts of it or the entire engine, i can port it to C++ and expose Python bindings so maintain UI in Python and by doing
this keep relatively high speed of development. But somehere deep inside me i want to stay in Python entirely. Don't want
to mess up with C++ on my own. But if there would be a team...

Stay tuned!
